#### Explanation

Specifications for APIs within the energy sector and documentation within the API definition (like fields 'description' and 'example') are set in the English language. This extends to all resources and attributes.

#### Rationale

ASNO prescribes the use of the Dutch language (API-04). Design guideline for the energy sector for the definition of the interface is UK English (or British English) because this language is more in line with (international) standards such as IEC CIM and ebIXÂ®.

#### Exceptions

Individual companies may follow their own guidelines on language usage.

Service descriptions may either be in English or in Dutch.
