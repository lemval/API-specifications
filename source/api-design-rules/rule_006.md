| Title    | __06 - Use of ODATA__ |
| :----    | :---------- |
| Strategy | APIs should be specified in OAS. |

Open section for explanation, rationale and exception conditions

#### Explanation

In principle, no support for ODATA in the NEDU API strategy.

#### Rationale

A detailed use case will determine which type of API is best. For APIs where datasets can be requested in many ways, ODATA is a possible option. Keep ODATA or WFS as a separate standard, do not force them in OAS/API form.

#### Exceptions

None.
