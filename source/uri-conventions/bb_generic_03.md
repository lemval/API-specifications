### ID 03

#### Central URIs are named independently of the organisation

<details><summary>

Open section for implications, rationale and examples 

</summary>

#### Implications

Local services are the responsibility of the organization that offers this service. For centrally offered URIs, a central organization in the energy sector must be responsible for maintaining the DNS records (otherwise there is a chance of proliferation, unintended name clashes).

#### Rationale

Only services that have a national or central character within the energy sector
must adhere to the agreements made in this document. The same/similar services that are offered locally by one or more providers are outside the scope.

#### Examples

National, central service that is in scope: CMF
Decentralised: services that sector members perform themselves, such as customer services, asset management, etc.
