### Introduction to naming

To arrive at a good naming of objects (in this context: resources) is not trivial. The reason is that a name only has meaning for people, not for systems. A name can therefore be called completely arbitrary.
The names proposed here for URI objects are built up from various characteristics. For each characteristic, 
a consideration will be made as to whether it is meaningful in the context of the energy sector and what the best way to fill this in is.
