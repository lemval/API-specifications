## Adding to the document

First, create a branch off of the main branch called 'feature/*my_change*'. Update the documentation and push. Then, create a pull request and inform the team.

Publications are pushed to the publication branch via the main branch. Do edit the publication branch directly.

For updating the document, see for an extensive description the [Getting start pages](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) or dive directly into the [flavoured specification](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

See here for configuration on Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/default/. Update the _config.yml file accordingly. A valuable source is also: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart (see section on Jekyll).
