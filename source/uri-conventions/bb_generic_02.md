#### URIs are stable for a long time

#### Implications

URIs do not contain organisation names, system names, project names, server names, etc.

#### Rationale

In order to increase the agility of the APIs or the IT landscape, it is necessary
to keep the impact of change as small as possible. Sustainable URIs contribute to this.

#### Examples

An example of a bad URI, used for time administration: `https://pnp-webdisp.bedrijf.local:8190/irj/portal/urenverantwoording`.
This URI is, in addition to the fact that it is not easy to read and remember, very
application-specific and shows implementation complexity. As a result, it is not
stable in the long term. What if we switch to other software, another
port? Then users have to adjust their links. If this can be prevented, this is preferred.
Companies can merge or get new names. A long-term stable URI provides for these types of scenarios.
