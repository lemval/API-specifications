#### Implications

Because capital letters are not allowed, the readability of paths can be reduced in
some cases. A hyphen can then be used to increase readability (together also called kebab case).

#### Rationale

URIs consist of a domain part and a resource part. The internet standard RFC3986 requires lower case letters for the domain part. Capital letters could be used in the resource part, but for the sake of clarity and unambiguity, this convention has opted to require lower case letters, also for the resource part.
