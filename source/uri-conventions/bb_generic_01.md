#### URIs are resource-oriented

Open section for implications, rationale and examples 

</summary>

#### Implications

Resources always represent things or objects (nouns). The function (verb) that acts on a Resource, as is
usual in the naming of web services, is therefore not allowed in this naming.

#### Rationale

In order to be able to share information easily on a global scale, a renewed
insight into the development of network-oriented applications was needed. The
combination of the Internet standards HTTP (RFC2616) and URI (RFC3986)
led to the current resource orientation in Roy Fieldingâ€™s dissertation in 2000.

#### Examples

Illustrative examples for resources are:
+ market-agreements (CIM)
+ power-generating-modules (NC RFG)
