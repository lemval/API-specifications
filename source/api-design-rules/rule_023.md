</summary>

#### Explanation

APIs are to be specified as OpenAPI Specification v3 or higher. Details to be found at the [OpenAPI initiative](https://www.openapis.org/) and [https://spec.openapis.org/#openapi-specification] for all specification versions. 
 
We use the JSON format, as we do not support the YAML format. This is conform ASNO API-16 [\[2\]](../references.html).

#### Rationale

By agreeing on a single specification format (JSON) in accordance with the OAS standard, coordination and collaboration between providers and consumers is simplified and improved. The process that providers publish APIs in JSON format in accordance with OAS3 leads to predictability, improved interoperability and contributes to a higher developer experience for consumers.
