### ID 07

| Title    | __07 - Definition of attributes Info object__ |
| :----    | :---------- |
| Strategy |  Every API (from OpenAPI 3.0 and higher) must be provided with an Info object with information about the API. |

<details><summary>

Open section for explanation, rationale and exception conditions 

</summary>

#### Explanation

The following attributes must be included in the Info object:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title:
  description:
  termsOfService:
  contact:
    name:
    email:
  license:
    name:
    url:
  version:
  x-releaseDate:
```

The `version` attribute specifies the version number of the API as included in the URI (URI component \<version\>) according to the rules of semantic versioning.

The `x-releaseDate` attribute specifies the date ([ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)) on which the REST API was released for use. This concerns a specification extension and therefore starts with `x-` (see <https://swagger.io/docs/specification/openapi-extensions/>).

For formatting texts of attribute `description`, the [CommonMark syntax](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/) should be used according to the OAS specification.

#### Rationale

Adding this information provides context to the API for users, as can be seen by the following example.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: connection-details
  description: |
    # API Version - 2.0.1
    #### Generated by ECDM Toolkit version 2.7.1
    This API offers functionality for the retrieval of connection details.
