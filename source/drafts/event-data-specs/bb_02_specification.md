## Event Data Specification

This Event Data Specification is a guideline for events designed and developed by the energy sector and takes precedence over the NL GOV profile for CloudEvents [\[12\]](../references.html).

These specification guidelines are grouped by theme:
1. specification of the defined context attributes. Each type of event (information-poor or information-rich) must contain this defined attribute set. This is described in guidelines ID01 to ID08
2. defined file size of an event. Described in guideline ID09;
3. defined case convention. Described in guideline ID10.

Finally, an example of an event message is shown. The guidelines are numbered consecutively and follow the above-mentioned thematic order.
