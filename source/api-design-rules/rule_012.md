| Title    | __12 - Quality of Service specification__ |
| :----    | :---------- |
| Strategy | Each API has a Quality of Service specification (QoS). |

<details><summary>

Open section for explanation, rationale and exception conditions 

</summary>

#### Explanation

Aspects to include in the QoS:
+ Integration latency;
+ Opening hours;
+ Availability;
+ Capacity;
+ Reliability.

#### Rationale

The API Strategy for the Dutch government does not describe a Quality of Service specification. The spec must be added as information to both the OAS specification as well as in the business service description.

For a developer who wants to connect to the interface of the API, the required information must be included in the OAS specification. Business relevant information must be included in the relevant business service description.

#### Exceptions

None.
